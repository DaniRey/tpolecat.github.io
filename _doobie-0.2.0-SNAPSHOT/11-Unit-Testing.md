The YOLO-mode query checking feature demonstated in an earlier chapter is also available as a trait you can mix into your [Specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) unit tests.

### Setting Up

Note that the code in this chapter requires the `doobie-contrib-specs2` module.

```scala
import doobie.imports._, scalaz._, Scalaz._, scalaz.concurrent.Task

val xa = DriverManagerTransactor[Task](
  "org.postgresql.Driver", "jdbc:postgresql:world", "postgres", ""
)
```

And again, playing with the `country` table, here again for reference.

```sql
CREATE TABLE country (
  code        character(3)  NOT NULL,
  name        text          NOT NULL,
  population  integer NOT NULL,
  gnp         numeric(10,2),
  indepyear   smallint
  -- more columns, but we won't use them here
)
```

### The Specs Package

Here are some queries we would like to check. Note that we can only check values of type `Query0` and `Update0`; we can't check `Process` or `ConnectionIO` values, so a good practice is to define your queries in a DAO module and apply further operations at a higher level. 

```scala
case class Country(code: Int, name: String, pop: Int, gnp: Double)

val trivial = sql"""
  select 42, 'foo'
""".query[(Int, String)]

def biggerThan(minPop: Short) = sql"""
  select code, name, population, gnp, indepyear
  from country
  where population > $minPop
""".query[Country]

def update(oldName: String, newName: String) = sql"""
  update country set name = $newName where name = $oldName
""".update
```

Our unit test needs to extend `AnalysisSpec` and must define a `Transactor[Task]`. To construct a testcase for a query, pass it to the `check` method. Note that query arguments are never used, so they can be any values that typecheck.

```scala
import doobie.contrib.specs2.AnalysisSpec

import org.specs2.mutable.Specification

object AnalysisTestSpec extends Specification with AnalysisSpec {
  val transactor = DriverManagerTransactor[Task](
    "org.postgresql.Driver", "jdbc:postgresql:world", "postgres", ""
  )
  check(trivial)
  check(biggerThan(0))
  check(update("", ""))
}
```

When we run the test we get output similar to what we saw in the previous chapter on checking queries, but each item is now a test. Note that doing this in the REPL is a little awkward; in real source you would get the source file and line number associated with each query.

Query0[(Int, String)] defined at <console>:18
  
  select 42, 'foo'
+ SQL Compiles and Typechecks
+ C01 ?column? INTEGER (int4)    NULL?  →  Int
x C02 ?column? OTHER   (unknown) NULL?  →  String
   x OTHER (unknown) is not coercible to String according to the JDBC specification
     or any defined mapping. Fix this by changing the schema type to CHAR or VARCHAR;
     or the Scala type to an appropriate object type. (<console>:18)


Query0[Country] defined at <console>:20
  
  select code, name, population, gnp, indepyear
  from country
  where population > ?
+ SQL Compiles and Typechecks
x P01 Short  →  INTEGER (int4)
   x Short is not coercible to INTEGER (int4) according to the JDBC specification.
     Fix this by changing the schema type to SMALLINT, or the Scala type to Int or
     PersonId or JdbcType. (<console>:20)

x C01 code       CHAR     (bpchar)  NOT NULL  →  Int
   x CHAR (bpchar) is ostensibly coercible to Int according to the JDBC specification
     but is not a recommended target type. Fix this by changing the schema type to
     INTEGER; or the Scala type to String. (<console>:20)

+ C02 name       VARCHAR  (varchar) NOT NULL  →  String
+ C03 population INTEGER  (int4)    NOT NULL  →  Int
x C04 gnp        NUMERIC  (numeric) NULL      →  Double
   x NUMERIC (numeric) is ostensibly coercible to Double according to the JDBC
     specification but is not a recommended target type. Fix this by changing the
     schema type to FLOAT or DOUBLE; or the Scala type to BigDecimal or BigDecimal.
   x Reading a NULL value into Double will result in a runtime failure. Fix this by
     making the schema type NOT NULL or by changing the Scala type to Option[Double] (<console>:20)

x C05 indepyear  SMALLINT (int2)    NULL      →  
   x Column is unused. Remove it from the SELECT statement. (<console>:20)


Update0 defined at <console>:18

+ P01 String  →  VARCHAR (varchar)
+ P02 String  →  VARCHAR (text)
