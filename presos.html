<h3>presentations</h3>

<p>I give occasional presentations for PDXScala and would like to start speaking at conferences if I can get my confidence and motivation up. I'm pretty light on slides and heavy on talking and waving my arms around, so you may find the content puzzling. Yet people ask for slides so here they are.</p>

<p>Some of the slides done in <a href="http://remarkjs.com/">remark</a> have speaker notes, which you can toggle by pressing the <code>p</code> key.</p>
