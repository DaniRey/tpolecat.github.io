title: Talking About the "Current" Type in Scala
tags: scala

A common question on the `#scala` IRC channel is

> I have a type hierarchy ... how do I declare a supertype method that returns the "current" type?

This question comes up a lot because Scala encourages immutability, and methods that return a modified copy of `this` are quite common. The standard approach (and the one used by stdlib collections for example) is to use an **F-bounded type**, which *mostly* works, but can't fully enforce the constraint we're after (it still takes some discipline and leaves room for error). A better approach in many cases is to use a **typeclass**, which solves the problem neatly and leaves little room for worry. We will examine the problem and both solutions.

### The Problem

Say we have an open trait for pets, with an unknown number of implementations. Let's say every type of `Pet` has a name, as well as a method that returns an otherwise identical copy with a new name. 

> **Our problem is this:** for any expression `x` with type `A <: Pet`, ensure that `x.renamed(...)` also has type `A`. To be clear: this is a *static* guarantee that we want, not a runtime property.

And for the "actually..." crowd, no, we're not talking about singleton types today.

Right. So here is our first attempt, and one implementation.

```scala
trait Pet {
  def name: String
  def renamed(newName: String): Pet
}

case class Fish(name: String, age: Int) extends Pet {
  def renamed(newName: String): Fish = copy(name = newName)
}
```

Note that `name` is implemented via a case class field. The `renamed` method simply delegates to the generated `copy` method, but note that it returns a `Fish` rather than a `Pet`. This is allowed because return types are in covariant position; it's always ok to return something **more specific** than what is asked for.

Just as a sanity check, we can create a `Fish` and rename it and all is well; the static type of the returned value is what we want. In simple cases this may be good enough, so keep in mind that this does work.

```scala
scala> val a = Fish("Jimmy", 2)
a: Fish = Fish(Jimmy,2)

scala> val b = a.renamed("Bob")
b: Fish = Fish(Bob,2)
```

However a limitation of this approach is that our trait doesn't actually constrain the implementation very much; you are simply required to return a `Pet`, not necessarily the *same type* of pet. So here is a `Kitty` that turns into a `Fish` when you rename it.

```scala
case class Kitty(name: String, color: Color) {
  def renamed(newName: String): Fish = new Fish(newName, 42) // oops
}
```

We also run into problems trying to abstract over renaming. For example, this attempt at a general renaming mechanism fails to compile because the return type of `renamed` for an unknown `A <: Pet` is not specific enough; the best we can do is return `Pet`.

```scala
def esquire[A <: Pet](a: A): A = a.renamed(a.name + ", Esq.")
```
```
<console>:28: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Pet
 required: A
       def esquire[A <: Pet](a: A): A = a.renamed(a.name + ", Esq.")
                                                 ^
```

So this approach doesn't meet our stated goal of requiring that `renamed` return the same type, and we can't abstract over our renaming operation. So let's see what we can do if we make our types a bit fancier.



### F-Bounded Types

An F-bounded type is parameterized over its own subtypes, which gives us a means to "pass" the implementing type as an argument that we can use in the trait definition. The self-referential nature of `Pet[A <: Pet[A]]` is puzzling when you first see it; if it doesn't click for you just keep on reading and it should start making more sense.

```scala
trait Pet[A <: Pet[A]] {
  def name: String
  def renamed(newName: String): A // note this return type
}
```

Ok, so any subtype of `Pet` needs to pass "itself" as a parameter.

```scala
case class Fish(name: String, age: Int) extends Pet[Fish] {
  def renamed(newName: String) = copy(name = newName)
}

```

Again, all is well.

```scala
scala> val a = Fish("Jimmy", 2)
a: Fish = Fish(Jimmy,2)

scala> val b = a.renamed("Bob")
b: Fish = Fish(Bob,2)
```

And now we **can** write our generic renaming method because we now have a more specific return type for `renamed`: any `Pet[A]` will return an `A`.

```scala
scala> def esquire[A <: Pet[A]](a: A): A = a.renamed(a.name + ", Esq.")
esquire: [A <: Pet[A]](a: A)A

scala> esquire(a)
res8: Fish = Fish(Jimmy, Esq.,2)
```

So this is a big win. We now have a way to talk about the "current" type because it appears as a parameter.

However we still have a problem with lying about what the "current" type is; there is nothing forcing us to pass the correct type argument. So here again is our `Kitty` that turns into a `Fish`.

```scala
case class Kitty(name: String, color: Color) extends Pet[Fish] { // oops
  def renamed(newName: String): Fish = new Fish(newName, 42)
}
```

Rats. What we need is a way to restrict the implementing class *claiming* to be an `A` to *actually* be an `A`. And it turns out that Scala does give us a way to do that: a **self-type** annotation.

```scala
trait Pet[A <: Pet[A]] { this: A => 
  def name: String
  def renamed(newName: String): A 
}
```

Now when we try to define our fishy `Kitty` the compiler says nope.

```scala
case class Kitty(name: String, color: Color) extends Pet[Fish] {
  def renamed(newName: String): Fish = new Fish(newName, 42)
}
```

```
<console>:19: error: illegal inheritance;
 self-type Kitty does not conform to Pet[Fish]'s selftype Fish
       case class Kitty(name: String, color: Color) extends Pet[Fish] {
                                                            ^
```

This boxes us in considerably, and we may think we have won. But alas it turns out that we can still lie about the "current" type by extending another type that correctly meets the constraint. Subtyping has provided an unwanted loophole.

```scala
class Mammal(val name: String) extends Pet[Mammal] {
  def renamed(newName: String) = new Mammal(newName)
}

class Monkey(name: String) extends Mammal(name) // hmm, Monkey is a Pet[Mammal]
```

And on it goes. I am not aware of any way to further constrain the F-bounded type. So if we use this technique we can do fairly well, but we still can't totally guarantee that `renamed` meets the specificaton. Also note that the clutter introduced by the type parameter on `Pet` doesn't add any information; it's purely a mechanism to restrict implementations.

So let's try another approach.

### How about a Typeclass?

As is often the case, we can avoid our subtyping-related problems by using a typeclass. Let's redefine `Pet` without our `renamed` method, and instead define an orthogonal [typeclass](/2013/10/12/typeclass.html) to deal with this operation. 

```scala
trait Pet {
  def name: String
}

trait Rename[A <: Pet] {
  def renamed(a: A, newName: String): A
}
```

We can now define `Fish` and an *instance* of `Rename[Fish]`. We make the instance implicit and place it on the companion object so it will be available during implicit search.

```scala
case class Fish(name: String, age: Int) extends Pete

object Fish {
  implicit val FishRename = new Rename[Fish] {
    def renamed(a: Fish, newName: String) = a.copy(name = newName)
  }
}
```

And we can use an implicit class to make this operation act like a method as before. With this extra help any `Pet` with a `Rename` intance will automatically gain a `renamed` method by implicit conversion.

```scala
implicit class RenameOps[A <: Pet](a: A)(implicit ev: Rename[A]) {
  def renamed(newName: String) = ev.renamed(a, newName)
}
```

And our simple test still works, although the mechanism is quite different.

```scala
scala> val a = Fish("Jimmy", 2)
a: Fish = Fish(Jimmy,2)

scala> val b = a.renamed("Bob")
b: Fish = Fish(Bob,2)
```

With the typeclass-based design there is no simply way to define a `Rename[Kitty]` instance that returns anything other than another `Kitty`; the types make this quite clear. And our `esquire` method is a snap; the type bounds are different, but the implementation it is identical to the one in the F-bounded case above.

```scala
scala> def esquire[A <: Pet : Rename](a: A): A = a.renamed(a.name + ", Esq.")
esquire: [A <: Pet](a: A)(implicit evidence$1: Rename[A])A

scala> esquire(a)
res10: Fish = Fish(Jimmy, Esq.,2)e
```

blah blah awkward splitting of concerns
